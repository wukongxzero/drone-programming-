# drone-programming-'

This is an autonomous drone development project started on 14/2/23.

The goal is to develop drones to be used to map/path planned for construction/agricultural/military and life-saving purposes. working on a new startup aerial-monkeys//.

step 1: learn drone-development and list out sources that  are valuable in this industry..
 
okay, if found a few books that i will start to implement and learn from and teach in this specific open git hub repo:

books that are going to be used:
1. Ros robotic projects by lentil joseph: 

2. Building Smart Drones with ESP8266 and Arduino: Build exciting drones by leveraging the capabilities of Arduino and ESP8266 by syed omar faruk

3. algorithms for robots motion and planning by jean-paul launmond for path planning.

4. probability robotics by sebastian thrun which is a great book to start learning robotics. 

all of which you can find in this repository,.

okay, after a lot of digginig in, time to get started with PX4 Development as this will form the basis of every autonomy project that will be developed in future or now,

PX4 DEV,

ROS2 DEVELOPMENT:
