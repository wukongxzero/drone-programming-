# drone-programming-'

This is an autonomous drone development project started on 14/2/23.

The goal is as simple as developing drones to be used to map/path planned for agricultural/military and life-saving purposes.

step 1: learn drone-development and list out sources that  are valuable in this industry..
 
okay, if found a few books that i will start to implement and learn from and teach in this specific open git hub repo:

books that are going to be used:
1. Ros robotic projects by lentil joseph: 

https://github.com/Honei/bookshelf/blob/master/Computer%20Science/ROS%20Robotics%20Projects.pdf

2. Building Smart Drones with ESP8266 and Arduino: Build exciting drones by leveraging the capabilities of Arduino and ESP8266 by syed omar faruk

3. algorithms for robots motion and planning by jean-paul launmond for path planning.

4. probability robotics by sebastian thrun which is a great book to start learning robotics.
